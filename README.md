# RSA in PowerShell
This project provides a full and pure implementation of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptography algorithm in PowerShell. 


### Features:
- Full implementation of RSA, including key generation, encryption, and 
decryption, Signatures and signature verification
- Support for variable key sizes
- Use of the Miller-Rabin primality test to generate large prime numbers
- Use of the Extended Euclidean algorithm for modular inverse computation
- A unique algorithm for converting integers to byte arrays and vice versa
- An algorithm for fast exponentiation and modulo computation with a time complexity of O(log n)
